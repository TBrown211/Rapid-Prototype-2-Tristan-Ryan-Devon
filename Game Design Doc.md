# What is our Mechanic? 

The baseline function that we want to achieve is the ability to have a charge attack to destroy a wall.  

If there is enough time, we would like to implement a mechanic so the charge attack will send the player flying forward.  

# Objective Statement 

Our is to combine movement and attack force to a character so the impact of them hitting a wall gives the allusion to the wall at high enough speeds and have the wall crumble apart.  

 

# Design Rational 

What we invasion for our design is a 1 screen design to show of the feature of the charge punch that we are going to add and if we have time, we are planning on having other 1 screen level 

Our charge attack mechanic is innovative mainly for the fact where in most games that implement, involves movement and traversal through levels; whereas our mechanic would allow for not only traversal, but also passing through any obstacles in the playerâ€™s path.
